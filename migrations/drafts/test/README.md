# Testing the drafts on a throwaway Postgres

`harness.sql` is a stand-in for the parts of `gradebook-prod` the drafts
touch: the `anon` / `authenticated` / `service_role` roles, `auth.uid()`
read from `request.jwt.claim.sub`, the `teacher`, `course`, `student` and
`enrollment` tables with RLS, `fv_idempotency` with `fv_idem_check` /
`fv_idem_store`, `fv_owns_course` / `fv_owns_enrollment`, and two seeded
teachers (A owns course `aaaaaaaa-…` with two students, B owns `bbbbbbbb-…`
with one).

`run.py file.sql…` splits each file into statements and runs them in order.
`functional.py` runs every RPC as Teacher A, then as Teacher B, then with no
JWT, then as `anon`, inside one transaction that is rolled back.

```bash
PGPORT=54329 python3 run.py harness.sql ../report_template.sql ../report_issue.sql ../guardian.sql
PGPORT=54329 python3 functional.py
```

Needs the `pg8000` package (pure Python; point `PG8000_PATH` at it if it is
not installed) and an empty database (`PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGDATABASE`,
`PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`). Never point it at `gradebook-prod`.

Result on 2026-10-20 (Postgres 17.10, local): 46 of 46 checks pass. The run
found one defect, fixed in both drafts: `jsonb_typeof(form->'front') =
'array'` is NULL when `front` is missing, and a NULL check passes, so a form
with no `front` array was accepted. The check now wraps it in `coalesce`.
